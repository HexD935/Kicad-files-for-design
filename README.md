Problem Description
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________
The goal is to create a robot that can solve a maze without external interference. This robot is known
as a Micro-Mouse(MM) and has become a somewhat infamous engineering example, with many trying
to make them solve the mazes faster and faster. A typical MM includes 4 major subsystems: power,
sensing, processor, and motherboard. This is being made for a university assignment where speed
does not matter. The specific part of the robot that has been assigned is the power subsystem which
will communicate with the MMâ€™s microcontroller(uM) and various other parts to provide the required
currents and voltages to the required systems. As such the sensing, processor, and motherboard have
already been designed. The power system will need to interface with the motherboard that will connect
the rest of the subsystems and power the entire MM.
